# robocode
code for the ritenour high school robotics team

Welcome to the Github for our Robotics team, this is where we'll store all the finished and unfinished code, as well-
as plans for future code and suggestions for future code.

Each programming member should probably have their own github account (Don't worry, it's easy enough), 
it'll be easier to contribute to the code we have here and more organized (So we aren't all using the same account).

GUIDELINES
1. Whenever contributing to the collection of code, make sure it is in the proper folder.
2. Always add your name to each contubution when using main account.
3. If you see a problem with one of the contributations, make sure to use the issues function on the sidebar for that-
specific piece of code.
4. Make sure to have a friendly attitude and be nice,- 
and make sure you give constructive critisism when using the issue tab.
